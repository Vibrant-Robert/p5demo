# Interaction Statement

There are 2 different modes, first is dots/circle mode, second is line mode. After the tutorial, one can press either 1 or 2 to change the mode.
In mode1, the diameter and color of the circle change with the amplitude of the music. In mode2, the direction and color of the lines can be changed
via the microphone(Press M to turn on/off). In both modes, one can create new items by dragging across the screen, and clear the view by clicking, and
create random items by double clicking.
